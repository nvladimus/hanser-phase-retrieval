My calculation assumes quasi-monochromatic light while the input images were acquired with fluorescence light of ~30nm bandwidth. I think this explains why the reconstructions have more pronounced oscillations. However, the reconstructions of the defocused point spread functions are quite similar to the input data. In particular the divergence and the assymetry in the ring structure is recovered.
